  	<h1>President Aoun is an Alien</h1>

    <img src="images/firefox2.png" alt="A Great Browser">


    <p>Everyone get's the emails from President Aoun about the inevitable robot takeover. When I was a child, I watched Iron Giant and believed that robots were our friends. Aoun is trying to convince us otherwise.</p>

    <h4>But aliens aren't real...that's what he wants you to think</h4>

    <p>This website's purpose is to declare that Aoun is an alien. The reddit hivemind has touched on it, now its time to really open your eyes. Much like the 'Philly Special', Aoun is trying to make us believe that robots are the real problem. What he doesn't want you to know is that he is in fact an alien. No, not the guys south of the border that POTUS wants you to think are going to kill your children.</p>

    <p>President Aoun</p>

    <ul>
    	<li><strong>IS</strong> From Outer Space</li>
    	<li><STRONG>LIVES</STRONG> in a Flying Saucer</li>
    	<li><STRONG>HATES</STRONG> robots</li>
    	<li><STRONG>WANTS</STRONG> your money.
    </ul>

    <p>He also wants your money. Not to make Marino better, but to prepare for the alient hostile takeover.</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>Take notice</li>
    	<li>Be prepared</li>
    	<li>Eat your vegetables (I've been eating three servings of spinach a day, it's wild.)</li>
    </ul> 

    <button>Question though</button>

    <p><small>This is no way supported by <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern</a>, it's alumni network or faculty. There is no evidence to support that Aoun is in fact an alien. However, there also is no evidence that he is not.</small>
